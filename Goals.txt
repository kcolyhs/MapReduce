Goals:
-Parse arguments
-Parse input file to create dynamic token list
-Divide token list into n map tasks
-Each task vectorizes their tokens and then merges using memcpy into a vector list
-sort(shuffle phase) the vector list using strcmp()
-Divide the vector into n reduce tasks
-Merge the sorted reduced vectorlists
-Collapse repeats and then print to output file
